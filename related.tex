Using client side measurement to either monitoring or reconfigure wireless
networks has received a lot of attentions in recent years. Mishra \textit{et al.}
proposed to collect client-side measurements called \textit{site-report}, which
contains the client's visibility to near-by APs or devices. These information
are then used in determining AP channel
assignment~\cite{mishra:mccr2005,dasilva:mswim2008,mishra:mobicom2006}, or joint
channel assignment and terminal association~\cite{mishra:infocom2006}. Sen
\textit{et al.} proposed to use mobile devices to measure and improve the performance of
wide-area cellular networks~\cite{sen2011can}. Finally, RadioMap~\cite{radiomap}
is a project at DARPA which aims to provide realtime awareness of radio spectrum
using idle radios equipments.

Our proposed approach differs from existing ones in follow aspects. First, we
identify smartphones as an ideal vantage point for both long-term network
monitoring and short-term network reconfiguration purpose, due to its
\textit{always on } and \textit{mostly idle} nature. Second, we distinguish
between active and passive clients and propose to only collects measurements
from passive clients, and exploit device proximity detection to jointly optimize
network performance for both.  Third, we consider incentives for clients to
provide measurement data and also validations of clients' measurements, which
are missing in previous works.
