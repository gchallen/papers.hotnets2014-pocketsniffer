Using client side measurements to either monitor or reconfigure wireless
networks has received a lot of attention recently. Mishra et al. proposed to
collect client-side measurements called site-reports, which represent the
client's visibility to near-by APs and other devices. This information is
then used to determine AP channel
assignment~\cite{mishra:mccr2005,dasilva:mswim2008,mishra:mobicom2006}, or
joint channel assignment and terminal association~\cite{mishra:infocom2006}.
Sen et al. proposed to use mobile devices to measure and improve the
performance of wide-area cellular networks~\cite{sen2011can}. Finally, the
DARPA RadioMap~\cite{radiomap} project aims to provide real-time awareness of
radio spectrum using idle radios on user devices.

Our approach differs from previous ones in several ways. First, we identify
smartphones as an ideal vantage point for both long-term network monitoring
and short-term network reconfiguration, due to their \textit{always on} and
\textit{mostly idle} nature. Second, we distinguish between active and
passive clients only collect measurements from passive clients, exploiting
device proximity detection to jointly optimize network performance for both.
Third, we consider incentives for clients to provide measurement data and
measurement validation mechanisms, which are missing in previous works.
