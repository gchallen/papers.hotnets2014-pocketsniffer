\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclusions}

Today millions of smartphones represent a pervasive, highly-available, but
also woefully-underutilized wireless monitoring network. We have presented
the \PS{} system which harnesses the power of always-on but mostly-idle
smartphones to improve network performance for nearby active clients by using
network measurements to drive both short-term network adaptation and
long-term monitoring and debugging.
