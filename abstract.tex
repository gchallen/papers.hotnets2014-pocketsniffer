The hundreds of millions of deployed smartphones provide an unprecedented
opportunity to collect data to monitor, debug, and continously adapt wireless
networks to improve performance. In contrast with previous mobile devices,
such as laptops, smartphones are \textit{always on} but \textit{mostly idle},
making them available to help other nearby active devices make better use of
available network resources. We present the design of \textsc{PocketSniffer},
a system delivering wireless measurements from smartphones both to network
administrators for monitoring and debugging purposes and to algorithms
performing real-time network adaptation. By collecting data from smartphones,
\PS{} facilitates experimentation with novel collaborative adaptation
strategies based around common network deployment scenarios. We present
preliminary results from a \textsc{PocketSniffer} prototype and discuss open
challenges in this area.
