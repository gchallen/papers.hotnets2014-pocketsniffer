The hundreds of millions of deployed smartphones provide an unprecedented
opportunity to collect data to monitor, debug, and adapt a variety of
wireless networks. In contrast with previous generation mobile devices, such
as laptops, smartphones are \textit{always on} but \textit{mostly idle},
making them an ideal platform for performing wireless measurements. We
describe the design of \PS{}, a system delivering smartphone measurements to
algorithms performing continuous network adaptation to improve performance
for active clients. We present preliminary results from a \PS{} prototype and
discuss open challenges in this area.
