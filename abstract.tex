\sloppypar{The hundreds of millions of deployed smartphones provide an
unprecedented opportunity to collect data to monitor, debug, and continuously
adapt wireless networks to improve performance. In contrast with previous
mobile devices, such as laptops, smartphones are \textit{always on} but
\textit{mostly idle}, making them available to perform measurements that help
other nearby active devices make better use of available network resources.
We present the design of \textsc{PocketSniffer}, a system delivering wireless
measurements from smartphones both to network administrators for monitoring
and debugging purposes and to algorithms performing real-time network
adaptation. By collecting data from smartphones, \textsc{PocketSniffer}
supports novel collaborative adaptation algorithms designed to support common
deployment scenarios involving both cooperative and self-interested clients
and networks. We present preliminary results from a \textsc{PocketSniffer}
prototype and discuss challenges to realizing this vision.}
