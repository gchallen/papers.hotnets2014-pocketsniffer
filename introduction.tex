\section{Introduction}

The rapid proliferation of smartphones creates both challenges and new
opportunities for wireless networks. On one hand, smartphones compete for the
same limited spectrum already crowded with other devices. On the other hand,
the growing network of mobile, always-on smartphones constitutes an
unprecedented new source of detailed network measurements. Because
smartphones are \textit{always on} but \textit{mostly idle}, they are ideal
for observing other nearby active wireless devices---such as laptops,
tablets, or other smartphones. When used for continuous network adaptation,
offloading measurements from active to inactive clients allows data
collection to avoid disturbing active sessions, a capability that has not
been adequately exploited by other systems using client-side
feedback~\cite{vasan:infocom2005,mishra:mccr2005,dasilva:mswim2008,mishra:infocom2006,mishra:sigmetrics2006,mishra:mobicom2006,murty:hotnets2008,rayanchu:mobicom2011}.
When used for network monitoring and debugging, measurements from mobile
smartphones provide more valuable data than approaches such as planned site
surveys, since the data that smartphones provide is continuous and
representative of wireless conditions experienced by users while surveys are
neither. We refer to these approaches collectively as \textbf{c}rowdsourcing
\textbf{a}ccess \textbf{n}etwork \textbf{s}pectrum \textbf{a}llocation using
\textbf{s}martphones, or \textbf{CANSAS}.

Realizing CANSAS requires novel integration between smartphones and an
adaptive network, along with new algorithms enabling cooperative spectrum
allocation on both short and long timescales. This paper describes a
prototype system implementing CANSAS for Wifi networks called \PS{}.
Implemented as a smartphone app, \PS{} is straightforward to deploy. It uses
a pub-sub architecture to collect data from passive smartphones and use
measurements to improve network performance. To enable short-term adaptation
measurements are triggered by and used as inputs to new
algorithms---including game-theoretic approaches---that can alter channel
assignments, control AP power levels and rate selection, and alter client
associations in order to improve spectrum efficiency. \PS{} allows different
algorithms to be deployed to support a variety of different network
structures, including both fully-cooperative settings and cases where
multiple networks overlap and compete for the local spectrum resources,
scenarios representative of both typical home and corporate Wifi deployments.
To enable long-term adaptation measurements are provided to network
administrators in order to perform network monitoring, maintenance, and
capacity planning. Realizing \PS{}, however, requires addressing a set of
open research challenges, including determining how to incentivize client
measurements, ensure that data provided by clients is accurate, reduce and
ensure fairness in the energy consumed by the measurement process, and deal
with significant variation in the measurement capabilities across different
smartphone models.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We begin by describing how
using passive smartphones improves on previous client-side measurement
approaches in Section~\ref{sec-related}. Section~\ref{sec-design} briefly
describes the design of the data collection portions of \PS{} while
Section~\ref{sec-algorithms} discusses several game-theoretic algorithms that
utilize \PS{} measurements to perform spectrum adaptation. We continue by
presenting results from a prototype \PS{} system in Section~\ref{sec-results}
before discussing open challenges in Section~\ref{sec-challenges} and
concluding in Section~\ref{sec-conclusions}.
